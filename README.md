# gold-silver-solubility-plots
R code written for the CHNOSZ R package (http://www.chnosz.net) to plot gold and silver solubility diagrams 

I wrote these scripts to produce diagrams in support of my masters thesis in 2017.  I include the code as well as an Adobe Illustrator file which vectorized and prettied up the products for publication.

Thanks to Jeffrey Dick for his help in adding the capability of plotting metal solubility in CHNOSZ.  We based the diagrams off of Williams-Jones et al. (2009) and Liang and Hoshino (2015). 

Please use freely and contact me if you need any help adjusting the parameters.
